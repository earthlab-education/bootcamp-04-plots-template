    "1. Before you submit your assignment to GitHub, make sure to run the entire notebook with a fresh kernel. To do this first, **restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart & Run All)\n",

    "3. Any open ended questions will have a \"YOUR ANSWER HERE\" within a markdown cell. Replace that text with your answer also formatted using Markdown.\n",
    "4. **DO NOT RENAME THIS NOTEBOOK File!** If the file name changes, the autograder will not grade your assignment properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only include the package imports, code, and outputs that are required to run your homework assignment.\n",
    "* Be sure that your code can be run on any operating system. This means that:\n",
    "   1. the data should be downloaded in the notebook to ensure it's reproducible\n",
    "   2. all paths should be created dynamically using the `os.path.join`\n",
    "   3. sort lists of dated files even if they are sorted correctly by default on your machine\n",
    "\n",
    "## Follow to PEP 8 Syntax Guidelines & Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run the `autopep8` tool on all cells prior to submitting (HINT: hit shift + the tool to run it on all cells at once!\n",
    "* Use clear and expressive names for variables. \n",
    "* Organize your code to support readability.\n",
    "* Check for code line length\n",
    "* Use comments and white space sparingly where it is needed\n",
    "* Make sure all python imports are at the top of your notebook and follow PEP 8 order conventions\n",
    "* Spell check your Notebook before submitting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of the plots below, be sure to do the following:\n",
